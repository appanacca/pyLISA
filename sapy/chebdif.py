def chebdif(N,M):
    '''Adopted from Weideman&Reddy's Matlab function chebdif.m.
    Input:
    N - size of diff matrix - np+1 where np is polynomial order.
    M - Highest derivative matrix order we need.
    Output:
    DM - (ell x N x N) - where ell=0..M-1.

    I will just paste the explanation from the original chebdif.m file:

    %  The code implements two strategies for enhanced
    %  accuracy suggested by W. Don and S. Solomonoff in
    %  SIAM J. Sci. Comp. Vol. 6, pp. 1253--1268 (1994).
    %  The two strategies are (a) the use of trigonometric
    %  identities to avoid the computation of differences
    %  x(k)-x(j) and (b) the use of the "flipping trick"
    %  which is necessary since sin t can be computed to high
    %  relative precision when t is small whereas sin (pi-t) cannot.

    I notice they also use the Negative Sum Trick (NTS) at the end.
    NTS is when you set diagonal entries to be negative sum of the
    other elements in the row.
