# SApy (Stability Analisys with Python)

The code implement the modal stability analysis in temporal framework.
It use the Chebyshev polynomials in a Gauss-Lobatto grid to discretize the stability equations.
Is it possible to solve:
* Orr-Sommerfeld equation
* Euler equation
* Orr-Sommerfeld equation with dissipative drag force inside a canopy zone
* Euler equation with dissipative drag force inside a canopy zone.

The base flow can be given as input in a text file, or you can use some basic flow already implemented (Poiseuille, Blasius boundary Layer).
Is it possible to compute the spectrum and chose which eigenfunction look at, by clicking to the selected eigenvalues.
 
Contact me if you are interested in the development of such tool !!!
